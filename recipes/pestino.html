    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, olive oil, white wine, orange juice, orange zest, crushed anise seeds, ground cinnamon, and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>

        <li>Cut the dough into diamond shapes or rectangles.</li>
        <li>In a deep pan, heat vegetable oil for frying to 350˚F (175˚C)</li>
        <li>Fry the pestiños in batches until they are golden brown on both sides. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, combine honey, water, and a cinnamon stick. Heat over low heat until the honey is melted and the mixture is well combined.</li>
        <li>Dip each fried pestiño into the honey syrup, ensuring it is coated evenly. Place them on a wire rack to allow excess syrup to drip off.</li>
